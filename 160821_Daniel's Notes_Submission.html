<!-- Part 1 -->

    <div>
    In Part I several key components behind a webpage are introduced, namely
    <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/">HTML</a>,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a>
    as well as
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">The Internet</a>
    and the basic function of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)">servers</a>.
    The <strong>hyperlinks</strong> provide overviews for the individual elements.

    In Part II of the first lesson the following tags were interoduced:
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>&ltb&gt</b> for making text bold
    <br>
    <b>&ltem&gt</b> for making text italic
    <br>
    <b>&lthref&gt</b> for making links
    <br>
    <b>&ltimg&gt</b> for adding images and
    <br>
    <b>&ltbr&gt</b> and <b>&ltp&gt</b> for creating whitespace
    <br>
    <br>
    Later the difference between inline and block tags was explained, using the example of <b>&ltspan&gt</B> vs <b>&ltdiv&gt</B>. Only block tags require closing tags.
    <br>
    Towards the end of the lesson there were some remarks on the overall document structure.
